# TouchMixxx

TouchMixxx is a [TouchOSC](https://hexler.net/products/touchosc) layout designed to control the Mixxx DJ software. TouchMixxx turns your iPad in to a 4 deck DJ controller giving you hands on performance controls for the key Mixxx controls.

##### Important:
* TouchMixxx and Mixxx are free, but you'll need to pay for TouchOSC MK1. That said, it's a great app and useful for controlling all sorts of MIDI-enabled software, so well worth the price of an overpriced coffee.
* Mixxx is available for macOS, Windows, and Linux, and TouchOSC MK1 is available for Android and iOS. However, TouchMixxx has not been tested with all these platforms. If it works, let me know; if it doesn't, let me know, and I'll see if I can fix it.
* TouchMixxx was designed for *TouchOSC MK1* and has not been tested with the new version of TouchOSC. As of March 2025, Hexler is still supporting [TouchOSC MK1](https://hexler.net/products/touchosc).

  Holding **SHIFT** increases the scrub speed.  
  _(The pads in Beat Jump mode can also be used to navigate through a track while paused or playing.)_
* When a track is playing, the **Jog Wheel** functions like touching the platter of a vinyl turntable,  
  allowing you to temporarily speed up or slow down the track for beatmatching.
* Below the jog wheel, the **+** and **-** buttons adjust the playback speed while held.
* If **SHIFT** is held while the track is playing, the **Jog Wheel** behaves as if you were touching the record,  
  allowing you to scratch or stop playback until **SHIFT** is released.

* Left of the **Jog Wheel** is the **Pitch Control** and **Sync** button.
* Pull the **Pitch Control** down to increase the playback speed, push up to decrease it.
* The **+** and **-** buttons adjust the pitch in small increments.
